Aim: To study and implement C++ decision making statements.

Software Used: VS Code.

Theory: 


Decision-making statements in C++ control program flow based on conditions. They allow the program to choose between different paths depending on logical evaluations.
The if statement executes a block if a condition is true. The if...else adds an alternative path when the condition is false. The else if chain handles multiple conditions. The switch statement is used for variable-based multi-way branching, ideal for discrete values like integers or characters.
These constructs are essential for implementing logic, validations, and responsive behavior in real-world applications like calculators, games, or embedded systems. Logical (&&, ||, !) and relational (==, <, >=, etc.) operators are often used within conditions.
Mastering decision-making strengthens algorithm design, enabling dynamic and interactive programs that adapt to varying inputs or runtime scenarios.


Syntax:

    if (x > 0) { ... }
    else if (x == 0) { ... }
    else { ... }

    switch(choice) {
    case 1: ...; break;
    case 2: ...; break;
    default: ...;
    }


Conclusion: Decision-making statements in C++ provide essential control over program flow, enabling dynamic logic, adaptive behavior, and efficient problem-solving through conditional execution and branching structures.
